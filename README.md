Patches the LotRO plugin Crafting Companion by Galuhad to work with Umbar craft tier and a 4th profession.

Note this is a 'quick & dirty' patch
- it doesn't account for chars that only have three craft skills, it leaves the fourth button there empty doing nothing
- it has not been thoroughly tested
- I did not delve very deep into the code so it is quite possible, even likely there's something(s) I missed
